# NOTE: The following tests are commented out because the required functions don't exist yet:
# - Dispatcher.start_link/1
# - Dispatcher.chat_completion/3  
# - Dispatcher.health_status/1
# - Dispatcher.list_workers/1
# - Dispatcher.add_worker/3
# - Dispatcher.remove_worker/2

# These tests should be uncommented once the Dispatcher module is fully implemented.
